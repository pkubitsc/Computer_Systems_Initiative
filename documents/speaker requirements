*Notes on the ‘following’ system:

          -if you search for a hashtag topic, you can see all posts without ‘following’ any of the people that posted on that topic
          -******Missed the part about effects of ‘unfollowing’...********
          -email notification if someone begins following you
          -if you block someone, that person will get an email saying so
